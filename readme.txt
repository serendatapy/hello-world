/*At the moment I feel I still have a mountain to climb, it's incredible
how someone can spend so much time learning and still feel
that no major breakthrough has been done. It does feel like
climbing a very VERY high mountain, however the fog
that precedes me is incredibly thick at times, and 
all my progresses seem almost efimeral and in vain. 
I know I'm better, but I'm worried about having to
remember all the things I've learned. And with so
many different things to learn, that at the moment
don't combine, and thus can't practice them all together
it does feel like one falls while one rises. It's
not easy to have faith in this juggling of abilities. 
and even more difficult to feel progress if I try to 
advance all skills at once...OMG!
